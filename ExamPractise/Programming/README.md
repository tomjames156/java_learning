# Inheritance

- When inheriting from a child class, variables declared as private cannot be called in the child class. 
- You can however use a setter or getter created in the parent class to access it.
- Protected vars are available within the same package and subclasses

- The super keyword is used in the sub class' constructor to pass arguments to the parent class' constructor.
- The super keyword used within a class method is also used to call the superclass version of an overriden method using the syntax super.methodName()


# Polymorphism

- The ability of a reference variable to behave different based on the object instance it holds. 
IMPORTANT!!! Above Syntax doesnt work on my vscode, try it on someone's system
Works on online compiler though
NOTE: Always put data types in methods and constructors
