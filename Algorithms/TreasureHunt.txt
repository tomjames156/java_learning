# Treasure Hunt Game

## Game Overview

In the "Treasure Hunt" game, the player navigates a grid-based map to find a hidden treasure. 
The map consists of various cells, some of which may contain obstacles, enemies, or helpful 
items. The player's goal is to reach the treasure without being stopped by obstacles or enemies.


### Pseudocode

CHAR[][] map // 2 dimensional array representing the game's map

/* Player's current position on the map */

newRow = row
newCol = col 

/* Condition to end the game */
quitGame = FALSE

/* Player's immunity status or lives remaining */
lives = 1

position player at start position

/* 
    T - Treasure
    E - Enemy
    O - Obstacle
*/
